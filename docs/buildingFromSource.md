# Building from source
Building the scraper from source may be preferable in some cases. This way, the app has a smaller footprint than a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/man90/bdo-rest-api).

## Prerequisites:
- GNU/Linux (other platforms should work as well but I haven't tested them)
- Go compiler >=v1.15

## Compilation
Use this command to compile the app:
```bash
go build
```
