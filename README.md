## How to start using it
There are two ways to use this scraper for your needs:
* By querying https://bdo.hemlo.cc/communityapi/v1 â€” this is the "official" instance hosted by me.
* If you want to have more control over the API, host the scraper yourself using one of the following methods:
  - As a Docker container: the image is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/man90/bdo-rest-api).
  - Natively: build the binary from source as described in [this guide](docs/buildingFromSource.md).

API documentation can be viewed [here](https://man90es.github.io/BDO-REST-API/).

```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Known bugs
There is a number of bugs that the official BDO website has. This scraper does not do anything about them for the sake of simplicity, so your apps may need to use [workarounds](docs/brokenStuff.md).
